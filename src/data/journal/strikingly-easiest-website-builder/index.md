Lots of companies promise to make it “quick” and “easy” to build a website, but few truly deliver. Strikingly is different.

## Pinocchio’s Digital Nose

“Launch a website in minutes” is a claim you hear from a lot of website building platforms, but it’s rarely accurate. In fact, many businesses will tell you that **building a simple website can take weeks or months**.

Heck, even I find most of these tools to be confusing at first—and that’s saying something because I’m a web developer and I spend 40–80 hours a week working on this stuff.

## Strikingly Delivers on Simplicity

The main reason Strikingly has long been my go-to recommendation for small businesses is that they keep things simple.

While companies like Wix and Weebly have endlessly over-stuffed their platforms with extra features for years (to try and satisfy any and all possible desires), Strikingly has grown slowly and strategically.

No experimental, “flavor-of-the-week” layouts.

No cheesy logo-maker tools.

No gaudy, distracting animations.

Just the features that **actually make a difference** for businesses.

## Editing is Clear and Intuitive

Recently, I helped a relative create a website for her nonprofit organization—she had no coding/tech experience, whatsoever, but it took all of about **30 seconds** for her to get a hang of Strikingly’s page editor.

Here’s an example of a “template” you can start out with:

Strikingly’s page editor is simple and intuitive, not overwhelming.

As you can see, **the interface is extremely concise**. There’s a menu on the left for pages and sections. Everything on the right (a preview of the site) is “click-to-edit”—text, forms, image backgrounds, you name it.

You can make changes and preview them before publishing anything to the live site, and even switch themes without losing your content.

## The Benefits of Bumper Guards

Website builders like Wix give you maximum control over your site’s design, which is great… until you realize you’re now responsible for **ALL the decisions** a professional web designer would normally make.

It took me about 5 seconds to **royally mess up this Wix theme** (below) by dragging text and images around.

This is far too easy to do, and it can be really difficult to figure out how to piece things back together once they break.

Wix makes it too easy to mess up your website.

With Strikingly, it’s a lot harder to mess up your website. You have control over the basics, like adding sections, reordering content, and uploading images, but the** technical design details are handled for you**.

For example, you can simply click a button to toggle through specific layouts (all of which look better than what you could hack together manually).

## The Features You Actually Need

Along with basic text and image sections, Strikingly offers options to display a blog, a simple store, social feeds, and galleries—plus you can use your own domain (which is easy to set up).

These features cover all the basic functionality a small business needs to run a simple, effective website. No more, no less.

## Customer Service That Makes You Smile

The first time I launched a Strikingly site for a client, I had a difficult time figuring out how to get their domain name “pointed” to Strikingly.

Within five minutes, the support team member I was chatting wrote up **step-by-step instructions** to solve the issue… even though the client’s domain was with a completely different (outdated) hosting company!

Everyone I’ve talked to is friendly and knowledgable—they seem to genuinely enjoy helping people use the platform.

## Super-Affordable Pricing

At $8–16/mo, Strikingly is a steal. While it’s simpler than other platforms, that simplicity ensures that your website is _always_ easy to edit—today, tomorrow, and two years from now.

This is important, as a lot of small business websites get built then abandoned because they’re too complicated or too time-consuming to manage.

## Wrapping Up

While tools like Strikingly can make it _easier _to build a website, they aren’t a substitute for the experience of a professional web designer.

At Sherpa Design Co., I work with teams and individuals every day to help them create Hard-Working Websites™ and grow their businesses online.
