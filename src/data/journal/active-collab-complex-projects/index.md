### Let’s be honest. Project management is the ugly duckling of freelance.

It can be extremely difficult, time-consuming, and boring. But, quite frankly, I think the tools — _not_ the process itself — are at fault.

When I started freelancing, I was using a combination of Microsoft Word documents, emails, and my brain to keep track of everything, which (spoiler alert) was a nightmare, not a viable project management system.

I knew project management apps were an option, but the cost (i.e. [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/pricing)) and overall clunkiness ([Trello](https://trello.com/), [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/projects), etc) kept me from using them for a long time.

### ActiveCollab to the Rescue!

I subscribed to [ActiveCollab](https://activecollab.com/) in the middle of a large website project that had become too much to manage via email and static notes.

The company promises a “Powerful, yet simple project management tool,” and that’s exactly what you get.

The interface is clean and modern, and it was, indeed, so simple to use that I got up-and-running in a matter of minutes.

### A Few Features I love

My favorite thing about ActiveCollab is that the app seems to “anticipate” what I need — whenever I find myself wanting a new feature, the first thing I try often works exactly as I expect.

**Multiple Platforms:** ActiveCollab can be downloaded for iPhone, accessed in the browser, or installed on your Mac (the desktop app is still a beta version, but performs marvelously).

**Sortable Projects:** It’s easy to create projects and assign them to a new or existing client. The various filters (client, category, etc) give me a quick bird’s eye view of everything I’m working on.

**Tasks and Lists:** Lists within a given project keep things organized, and you can add helpful details to individual tasks (like due dates, file attachments, and assigned team members).

**Pricing:** $25/mo is very reasonable!

### My Process For Building Websites

  1. **Preparation:** My first step is always to conduct an in-depth information gathering session with my client to discuss their primary challenges, and then define an effective solution.
  2. **Setup:** Next, I create a new ActiveCollab project from a pre-existing template to map out some high-level milestones, such as “Home Page Mockup Review,” “Testing,” and “Website Launch.”
  3. **Notes:** Whenever I have a call or receive input from a client, I take notes directly in ActiveCollab and parse out todo items into individual tasks, which ensures we don’t lose track of anything we discussed.
  4. **Accountability:** I assign all tasks to a team member, add due dates, and attach files, so everything can be managed from one location… no more scouring my inbox for elusive emails!
  5. **Debrief:** Once a project is finished, I check back on a task list called “Project Debrief,” which I use along the way to capture any mistakes or ideas for future improvement.
  6. **Implementation:** These get moved into specific templates or projects under my own company page (so I remember to implement them in my next project).
