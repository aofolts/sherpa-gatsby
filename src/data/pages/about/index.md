## Hi, I’m Andrew. Nice to meet you.

I am a Rochester, NY-based web designer and developer who helps small businesses make Hard-Working Websites™.

I love collaborating with passionate people to help turn their big ideas into smart code and unique designs.

### What’s my background?

After graduating from [Syracuse University](http://newhouse.syr.edu/) with a degree in creative advertising, I started my career as a [copywriter](http://bnoinc.com/), working with name brands like MasterCard and Johnson & Johnson.

I’ve also been building websites since 2007, so I know how tough it can be for businesses to navigate the massive number of technologies available—and figure out how to make them work to their advantage.

### Who do I work with?

Over the years, I’ve collaborating with businesses from lots of different sectors, but generally my clients offer products and services that have a _simple_ and _direct_ human impact.

Past projects have included a [delicious pizza joint](http://joesquared.com/) in Baltimore, a worldwide [learning company](/work/learning-everywhere/), and a certified [life coach](/work/connecting-core/).

### My Work Philosophy

When it comes to the web, I don’t think any one company or technology is “the best.” 

My number one goal is to understand the challenges your business is facing, and help you find the right solution.

### What do I do in my spare time?

When I’m not designing or coding, I love getting outdoors to run, backpack, or catch some live music. I’ve been a drummer since the third grade, and you can occasionally find me helping out at my [local running store](http://www.medvedrunwalk.com/) in Rochester.

### Let’s hear about you!

I love meeting creative people who are passionate about their work. Whether you’ve got a project in mind, or just want to say hi, feel free to [reach out](#contactForm).
