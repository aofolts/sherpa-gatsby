Located along the Hudson River, the Boathouse Grille offers great food and drinks, as well as an unbeatable view, bocce ball courts, nature trails, and much more.

I worked with owner Kathy Donovan to create a simple [Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com/)site to promote the restaurant.

## Flying High

Professional photography and arial drone footage of the grounds truly make the Boathouse Grille website come alive.

A simple layout makes it easy for people to find information quickly or scroll through at their leisure—enjoying a gallery and beautiful full-width backgrounds along the way.

## Helpful Features

The website also features live weather updates, a Google Map for directions, and a Facebook feed to keep people updated on the latest happenings at the Boathouse Grille.
