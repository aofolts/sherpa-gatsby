## Background

Since 2005, Learning Everywhere® has worked with federal agencies to deliver courses that have engaged thousands of learners in over thirty countries.

I helped CEO Sheila Stenhouse Lee create a website that showcases her team’s extensive experience and broad range of learning solutions.

## Unique Design

Learning Everywhere employs [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) as its primary font, which conveys a unique sense of friendliness and simplicity.

Clean icons draw attention to the company’s main services, and a vector mountain texture underlines some of its key achievements.

## Smart Code

A custom table of contents allows for visitors to easily load the Projects or Courses they are interested in viewing.

Extra info can be toggled into view for each module, making it much quicker to scroll through different sections on the page.
