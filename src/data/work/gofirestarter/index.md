Kathy Palokoff is the Chief Igniter of goFirestarter, a co-author of [_Firestarters_](https://www.amazon.com/Firestarters-Innovators-Instigators-Initiators-Inspire/dp/1633883477/), and my favorite creative partner!

We worked together to develop a simple, bold website to promote her marketing and strategy services.

## Bold Design

The site employs thick uppercase headlines to attract attention and drive home key messages.

Flame imagery enforces the goFirestarter brand, and helps to divide the landing page into distinct sections.

## Fresh Content

Firestarter “Fodder” is a simple blog that features branded series, like “Better Marketer,” where Kathy shares how everyday experiences can make us all better marketers.

I also built in the option for multiple authors, allowing guests like _Firestarters_ co-author Paul Eder to contribute to the goFirestarter knowledge base.
