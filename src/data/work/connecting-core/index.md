Cheryl Williams is a Baltimore, Maryland-based life coach and mediator with 20+ years experience in Consumer Package Goods R&D. We worked together on a single-page website for her new company, Connecting to the Core.

## Vibrant Design

The site’s color palette features light and dark shades of blue and red, which represent insight, experience, warmth, and energy.

Custom icons help convey key services quickly, and subtle gradients are used to suggest synergy between Cheryl’s unique strengths.

## Helpful Interactive Features

Downloadable documents, powerful testimonials, and a simple contact form make it easy for potential customers to get a clear overview of the company and connect with Cheryl.
